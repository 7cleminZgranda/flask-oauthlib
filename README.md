- **Use an online CAD service.** There are some online platforms that allow you to create and edit CAD drawings in your browser, without installing any software. Some examples are AutoCAD Web App , Onshape , and SketchUp Free . These services are free or have a low-cost subscription option, and they can import and export files in various formats, including DWG.

- **Use a free or open source CAD software.** There are some free or open source software applications that can perform similar tasks as AutoCAD 2000, such as drafting, modeling, rendering, and printing.
