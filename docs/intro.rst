Introduction
============

Flask-OAuthlib is designed as a replacement for Flask-OAuth. It depends on
the oauthlib module.


import this
-----------

Flask-OAuth was developed with a few :pep:`20` idioms in mind::

    >>> import this


#. Beautiful is better than ugly.
#. Explicit is better than implicit.
#. Simple is better than complex.
#. Complex is better than complicated.
#. Readability counts.

All contributions to Flask-OAuthlib should keep these important rules in mind.
